### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1, was great because it helped me feel more confident with coding. I learned to find the area of a rectangle, so the assignment was a little easier to understand too. Passing all tests and following linting rules made me feel proud and encouraged me to keep learning.

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1, was really enjoyable because it involved calculating the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) of athletes, a topic I find enjoyable. It was exciting to start using std::cin and std::cout, which became important tools in our future labs. This early exposure laid a strong foundation for more advanced programming assignments.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 2, was a bit tough  because we had to use different loops to make a pattern. Even though it was challenging, I gave it my best shot and managed to write the code. It was neat to apply what we learned about loops. Also itâ€™s funny to me because I was finishing the code while out of town in the middle of spring break.
